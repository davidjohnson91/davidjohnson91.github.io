        Object-Oriented CSS: Buttons
      </a>
      <p>Object-oriented CSS is an important skill and way to think when writing the class structure for websites today. The idea behind object-oriented CSS is to write basic styles that work in conjunction with each other to form the styles behind a single element. The best practice is to identify elements that are used throughout a website like news articles, inputs, or other elements and then apply unifying classes so that you can style them once and apply it throughout the project.</p>
